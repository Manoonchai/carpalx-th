# Calpalx (Thai)

Keyboard Layout Optimizer for Thai layouts, in TypeScript

## Why?

[Carpalx](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx) does not support Thai language, which has around 60+ unique alphabets and without capitalized letters.
So this is a Thai version of Carpalx, and also the extension which introduce typing effort model for shifted keys as well.

## Features

- [ ] Thai layout support, with Kedmanee & Pattachote
- [ ] Shifted keys typing effort model
- [ ] Adjustable parameters (eg. Dominant hand, pinky penalty weight, etc.)
- [ ] Ortholinear-layout support (eg. Planck, Ergodox)
